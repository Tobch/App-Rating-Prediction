The objective of this project is to develop multiple regression models to predict the app rating based on the provided dataset.
This task involves exploring various features such as category, number of reviews, install count, and more.
Students are expected to perform data analysis, apply preprocessing techniques, and utilize regression models to minimize prediction errors and deliver a strong predictive solution.


Project Overview: App Rating Regression

Dataset Description
The dataset contains a variety of features relevant to mobile applications published on the Play Store. Each row represents an app and includes attributes such as:
•	App Name, Category, Reviews, Size, Installs, Price.
•	The target variable is the App Rating, a float value between 1 and 5.
This mix of categorical and numerical features makes this a suitable challenge for building and comparing multiple regression models.
